## Model of the Business Domain
- A model is a simplified representation of a thing or phenomenon that intentionally emphasizes certain aspects while ignoring others. Abstraction with a specific use in mind.
- Omitting unnecessary details and leaving only what’s needed for solving the problem at hand.
- The model is supposed to include just enough aspects of the business domain to make it possible to implement the required system
e.g. A map: different maps for different purposes.

# Bounded context
A boundary of the model. It is the area where a specific model can be used.

Bounded contexts, on the other hand, are designed. Choosing models’ boundaries is a strategic design decision. We decide how to divide the business domain into smaller, manageable problem domains.

*It’s crucial to remember that subdomains are discovered and bounded contexts are designed.*
