## Ubiquitous Language
The software systems we are building are solutions to business problems. A company’s goal is to provide a solution for its customers’ problems.
To design an effective software solution, we have to grasp at least the basic knowledge of the business domain.

The software has to mimic the domain experts’ way of thinking about the problem—their mental models. It’s crucial for us to understand domain experts and to use the same business terminology they use.

A software project’s success depends on the effectiveness of knowledge sharing between domain experts and software engineers. We have to understand the problem in order to solve it.

Almost all software projects require the collaboration of stakeholders in different roles: domain experts, product owners, engineers, UI and UX designers, project managers, testers, analysts, and others.

The source code is used to communicate business domain knowledge to software engineers who will maintain the project later. 


**Using a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design.**
If parties need to communicate efficiently, instead of relying on translations, *they have to speak the same language*.

The ubiquitous language is the language of the business.

**The source code itself should use this language.**

Quite often, the most important knowledge is tacit. It’s not documented or codified but resides only in the minds of domain experts. The only way to access it is to ask questions.
You need to make sure the correct language is used where it’s easy to control it: **in the documentation and source code**.

A ubiquitous language is ubiquitous only in the boundaries of its bounded context.
